      <description>Review    Summary    Code.org has helped the cause and explained really well that learning to code coding is important
  Very well designed coding / gaming flow
  Hour of Code and Code Studio are the key aspects of the site.
  It has the visual programming environment that enables dragging coding blocks to solve a puzzle.
  Kindergartners might struggle a bit with use of mouse to navigate.</description>
