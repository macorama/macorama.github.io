      <description>The 2019 K-12 School Giants Report shows that many K-12 districts across the country are emphasizing hands-on, practical and personalized learning. Educators and parents recognize the need for better career and technical education that is aligned with future vocations in STEM, business, and skilled trades. As a result, 360-degree learning has emerged as one of the latest trends in K-12 education. Traditional curricula need to be revisited and better aligned with hands-on programs and activities so that students are set for success in the future.</description>
