      <description>Night Zookeeper is an online learning platform that helps kids ages 6-12 to improve their reading and writing skills. Good writing games and tools are not easy to come by online, in this humble momma&amp;rsquo;s opinion. Most emphasize reading aloud or basic spelling/vocabulary games. It was nice to find a site that was primarily dedicated to writing. What&amp;rsquo;s unique about Night Zookeeper is that it also offers feedback to its users, almost like an online teacher/tutor.</description>
