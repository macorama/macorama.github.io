      <description>Developmental and cognitive milestones are behaviors/skills that children exhibit at a given age.
  However all children develop differently and can reach these milestone at different times.
  The checklists that track milestones are just an example of a typical development observation at a given age.
  Some children develop more rapidly in some areas than in others, and the time frame in which a normally developing child reaches a certain milestone can vary quite a bit.</description>
