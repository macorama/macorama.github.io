      <description>Review    Summary  The best thing about Code.org is that they are spreading the word really well about why coding is important, fun, accessible, and relevant. great job getting famous people to help spread the word, which is really important. I&amp;rsquo;ve found its programming stages to be very motivating and the lesson plans behind them solid.
The site&amp;rsquo;s two main components are the Hour of Code and Code Studio.</description>
