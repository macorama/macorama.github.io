      <description>Overview  Parents need to know that Tynker is a Web-based course collection that teaches kids the logic of programming using visual blocks of code. Parents can register kids for two paid, self-paced online courses, Introduction to Programming and Game Design, or have kids work on several free coding games in the Hour of Code section, which includes a few activities that let kids program their own games or apps.</description>
